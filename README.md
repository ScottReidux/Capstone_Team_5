MSAAI â€“ 590: Capstone Project

## Description
Our capstone project tackles the challenge of efficiently identifying relevant grants by
creating a deep learning-based topic modeling system for grant characterization. The project
addresses a common issue: researchers and administrators often face an overwhelming number
of grant descriptions across platforms making it hard to find ones that align with their research
areas. By automating grant classification into specific topics our system will save time for
research teams helping them find targeted opportunities and boosting their chances of securing
funding.

For this project we built an RNN model to classify grants into catagories based on thier title, and compare that to the classifications that BerTopic produced.
